# Module-1-Challenge(Horiseon Marketing Page)
Updating and editing exisiting codebase that follows accessibility standards so that Horiseon Marketing site is optimized for search engines. 

## Description
Went through the webpage to ensure it meets accessibility standards. First I viewed the source code. I then found semantic HTML elements usiing VS Code. I then reviewed the structure of the HTML elements and found the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning. I ensured all image elements were tagged with an alt attribute to maximize accessabiliity for the user. I corrected the headiing attriibutes to have them fall in sequential order. Lastly, I made the title element concise and descriipton to the webpage.
